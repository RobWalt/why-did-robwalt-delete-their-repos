# Why did I delete my repos?

Perhaps you came here looking for anything I ever did.

All of that is gone, it's not coming back.

Why? Github is no longer a safe platform to host your code. And by extension any package manager inherently tied to github is not safe either. You know what I'm talking about. If you are baffled to learn that, if you just learned that from *me*, I have very little desire to continue this proverbial conversation.

So, where are my repos? Nowhere, they're just gone. I hope you can respect my decision and not ask me privately about them.

But if you're wondering where you should put your repos, I've heard https://codeberg.org/ is not a bad place to do so.

Also, within this repository, I placed the ultimate secret that is needed to achieve AGI. If you are looking for it you can try to find it, but you may have to look at the content very precisely and invest a lot of time to decode the secret.
