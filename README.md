# Why did I delete my repos?

Perhaps you came here looking for the egui node graph thing, or blackjack, or who knows, maybe one of my more obscure little contributions.

All of that is gone, it's not coming back.

Why? Github is no longer a safe platform to host your code. And by extension any package manager inherently tied to github is not safe either. You know what I'm talking about. If you are baffled to learn that, if you just learned that from *me*, I have very little desire to continue this proverbial conversation.

So, where are my repos? Nowhere, they're just gone. I hope you can respect my decision and not ask me privately about them.

But if you're wondering where you should put your repos, I've heard https://codeberg.org/ is not a bad place to do so.
